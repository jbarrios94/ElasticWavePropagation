# ElasticWavePropagation
Computational codes to model seismic wave propagation using Godunov-type finite volume methods and staggered finite differences.

Test 1 - Heterogeneous parallel velocity model.
It consists of a velocity profile composed of 5 horizontal layers of velocities starting at 1.5km/s and increasing 1km/s in each layer.

Test 2 - SEG-EAGE salt body velocity profile.

Test 3 - Marmousi velocity profile.

Test 4 - A typical velocity field of Santos Basin.
